                    <p class="post-date">March 25, 2022</p>

                    <p>This blog project has been in the back of my mind for far too long, but I have finally
                    managed to get an actual webpage up and running. I am definitely not too happy
                    with how it is currently styled, but I wanted to focus on adding content to it before
                    I finish designing the webpage's aesthetic. I think styling will be an ongoing effort throughout
                    this project's lifespan. I am excited to see how the design changes over time, so I plan to document signficant
                    changes I make. For reference, here is what the landing page originally looked like (what it looks like now):</p>

                    <p>I was able to make this website through GitHub Pages, and you can <a href="https://pages.github.com/">learn about how to
                        do this yourself here</a>. 
                    </p>

                    <p>What exactly is this blog for? I do not quite know as of now. The original goal was to document 
                        my job search process over the past 5 months, but it's a little late for that now so I 
                        plan to broaden the topics to general life updates. I want to mix in a variety of topics, ranging
                        from technical coding question solutions to exciting trips I go on - really anything that I want to write
                        about. I suppose I am thinking this blog will be a nice encapsulated archive to look back on
                        in the future so I can better remember this time in my life. Even if I am only looking back a few years ago,
                        sometimes it can be hard to recall what happened, so having a way to document these sorts of things
                        will be nice for that.
                    </p>

                    <p>I would not say I am amazing at website development, but I do think this project will
                        very much help build some more technicial expertise in that area. For starters, I want to 
                        be, at the very least, competent with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets</a>.
                        It is something I have really procrasinated, but, as tedious as it is to learn, I believe it will 
                        really payoff in the end.
                    </p>
